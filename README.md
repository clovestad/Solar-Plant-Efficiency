# Solar plant Efficiency
## Colin Lovestad
- Power production predictions to gauge duty cycle of plant components  to maintain peak efficiency.
- This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. The power generation dataset are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it.

## Data Cleaning
### Task
- Deleted unnecessary columns.
