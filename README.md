# Solar plant Efficiency
## Colin Lovestad
- Power production predictions to gauge duty cycle of plant components  to maintain peak efficiency.
- This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. The power generation dataset are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it.

## Data Cleaning
### Task
- Identify and delete unnecessary columns.
- Check duplicates and permit high cardiality columns(source_ID)
- Deleted null duplicate rows.
- perform Feature engineering on datetime column to split into  better data fit for modeling.
- Produced univariate visuals.
- identify any outliers.

  - the above table relates that the peak production hours are undoubtably in the midle of the day, while the sun is at its highest point.
